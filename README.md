# Word Counter
A bash script for counting words in a .txt file (Currently only .txt files are supported) 

Save  `wc.sh` to desired directory.

Modify `wc.sh` argument's mode with `chmod a+x`

Usage of this would be:

./wc.sh `text.txt` (where `test.txt` is the text file you wish to analyze and is in the same directory as `wc.sh`)

Output file will save to the current directory. See `output.txt` for simulated results.
